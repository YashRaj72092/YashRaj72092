Hi there! 👋
I'm a student who loves coding, and I'm just getting started with Python. This GitHub repository is where I'll be sharing my progress, practice exercises, and projects as I learn the basics of programming.

🚀 What I'm Learning
Python Basics: Variables, data types, and simple programs
Control Flow: If statements, loops, and logic
Functions: How to organize code into reusable pieces
Working with Data: Lists, dictionaries, and basic operations
📝 My Practice Projects
Here are some beginner projects I've been working on:

Hello World: My first Python program!
Simple Calculator: A basic calculator using Python.
Guess the Number: A small game where you guess a number.
I'll be adding more as I continue to learn! 🚧

🌱 What’s Next?
I’m excited to keep learning and explore:

Writing more complex programs
Understanding error handling
Experimenting with small Python libraries
Building simple games and tools
